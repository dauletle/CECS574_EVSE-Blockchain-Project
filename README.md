Vehicle to Grid (V2G) technology allows for electric vehicles (EVs) to supply power back to the grid via EV charging stations.  The concept of V2G has a wide variety of uses, from storing power generated by renewables to be used during higher-demand hours, to becoming an essential source of power during environmental disasters.  While the technology has been widely accepted, the implementation has been limited due to the restrictions the power utilities have in buying and selling power, particularly, the restrictions imposed with all of the banking systems the currency has to flow through to complete a transaction.  Blockchain-based energy provides a solution of solving this problem by decentralizing the energy transaction away from the power utilities and third parties, and thus, make V2G a reality.  This paper will go over the different types of Blockchain strategies that can be implemented to achieve the goal of decentralized energy transactions for V2G functionality.
